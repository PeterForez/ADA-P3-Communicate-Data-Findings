# Ford_GoBike_System_Data Data Exploration

The data consisted of bike duration and attributes of approximately 183412 rides.
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area during 2019.
Bay Wheels is the Bay Areaâ€™s regional bicycle share system that operates in the cities of Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, San Jose and the city and county of San Francisco.
Bay Wheels allows users to make point-to-point trips using shared bicycles.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found:

Strong relationship between the duration of the ride and distance travelled. 
   The time of the ride increase with the distance travelled.
  
In addition, the users are using bike to go to work and vice versa. 
   That's why the peek hour are at 8:00AM and 9:00AM in the morning.
   While for the evening, the peak hour are at 5:00PM and 6:00PM.
   But for weekend the use of the bike decrease significant 
   and it is used at 2:00PM while the person is enjoying the sun :)
   
The stations of the Bike are relatively close; they are within 3km diameter.
   The average duration of bike ride is 10min.

Regarding the Gender; the Male are using bike more frequently than Female.
   So, we need more advertising for Female to encourage them,

The youth are the category that use the bike the most. 
   The average age of biker is 33 years.

One itresting finding is that the average distance and duration time for Female is greater the Male.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus what is needed from the Bike company to increase their profit.
1. The rush hours are at 8:00AM, 9:00AM, 5:00PM and 6:00PM
   The company can create some promotion at 12:00 to encourage users take their lunch away from work
2. Most of the Bike users are youth between 24 and 40 years 
   The company can create some promotion for users older than 40 years
3. The Female are less than one third the Male users
   Create some promotions for females
4. The average bike use is 10min
   We can decrease the fees for the second 10mins
5. The customers tend to have longer duration than Subscriber
   We need to add more people to Subscriber category by any promotions
6. During weekends, the use of the bike decrease a lot
   More promotion dring weekends
